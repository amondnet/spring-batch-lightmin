= Spring Batch Lightmin
:toc:
:asciidoctor-source: ./spring-batch-lightmin-documentation/src/main/asciidoc

The _Spring Batch Lightmin_ is a client-server library on top of the _Spring Batch_ and _Spring Boot_ to monitor and configure _Spring Batch Jobs_.
By enabling the _Spring Batch Lightmin_, a _BatchConfigurer_ will be registered and provides

* JobRepository
* JobOperator
* JobExplorer
* JobLauncher
* JobBuilderFactory
* StepBuilderFactory

and depending beans out of the box.

== Getting Started

=== Server

==== Maven Dependencies

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.tuxdevelop</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-batch-lightmin-server</artifactId>
    <version>{spring-batch-lightmin.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

==== Enable the Server

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableSpringBatchLightminServer
public class LightminServer {


    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(LightminServer.class, args);
    }
}
----

The code above enables the _SpringBatchLightminServer_ with default properties.

===== Property Configuration

[source, yaml]
----
server:
  port: 8090
----

==== Server service discovery

In order to detected lightmin client via service discovery, the following property has to be set to true

[source, yaml]
-----
spring:
  batch:
    lightmin:
      server:
        discovery-enabled: true
-----

The server itself has to be a _DiscoveryClient_.

===== Server behind a Proxy

The server ui uses redirects and the _HOST_ header is taken to create the redirect urls. This is the default behavior of Spring MVC.
If the server ui is running behind a proxy, the implementation of the server takes care, that the _X-FORWARD-PREFIX_ header is used as well.

If the proxy cannot pass the _HOST_ header or you do not want to change the default, e.g. _Zuul_, the following property can force the server
to use the _X-FORWARDED-HOST_ header to build the redirect urls.

[source, yaml]
----
spring:
  batch:
    lightmin:
      server:
        use-x-forwarded-headers: true
----

=== Client

==== Maven Dependencies

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.tuxdevelop</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-batch-lightmin-client</artifactId>
    <version>{spring-batch-lightmin.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

==== Enable the Client

[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableSpringBatchLightminClient
public class LightminClient {

    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(LightminClient.class, args);
    }

}
----

The code above enables the _SpringBatchLightminClient_ with the default configuration.
The default configuration provides a _JdbcJobRepository_, _JdbcJobConfigurationRepository_ and
needs a configured _DataSource_ with the bean name _dataSource_.

In order to register to the _SpringBatchLightminServer_, the property
_spring.batch.lightmin.server.url_ has to be set.

===== Property Configuration

[source, yaml]
----
spring:
  batch:
    lightmin:
      server:
        url: http://localhost:8090
----

==== Service Discovery

The client library also provides support for service discovery with _Consul_ and _Eureka_.

In order to use service discovery, one of the spring cloud starter has to be on the classpath

The dependency below shows the consul integration

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-consul-discovery</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

In order to use the discovery feature of s_Spring Cloud_ one configuration class has to have the _@EnableDiscoveryClient_ annotation.

[source, java]
----
@EnableScheduling
@EnableDiscoveryClient
@EnableSpringBatchLightminClient
public class AddressMigratorApp {

    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(AddressMigratorApp.class, args);
    }

}
----


===== Auto registration server side

The client has to set the following property to activate the client side adaption for the server side auto registration.

[source, yaml]
----
spring:
  batch:
    lightmin:
      client:
        # default value: false
        discovery-enabled: true
----

If the property is set to _true_. the discovery client configuration will be enriched by meta tags, which let the server detected the _Spring Batch Lightmin_ clients.

If the server should be also found via service discovery, e.g. for push notifications, the next section will give all the details for the configuration.

===== Client side server discovery

In order to find the server via service discovery, the following properties has to be set.

[source, yaml]
----
spring:
  batch:
    lightmin:
      client:
        # default value: false
        discover-server: true
        # default value: lightmin-server
        server-discovery-name: lightmin-server
----

This will enable the following behavior

* The lightmin client will use service discovery for push notification to the server.
* The lightmin client will use service discovery to register at the server, if the following property is set to *false* or not present.

[source, yaml]
----
spring:
  batch:
    lightmin:
      client:
        discovery-enabled: false
----

===== Service Discovery for Remote Repository Server

If the client has configured service discovery, the following properties will activate client side auto detection for the _Remote Repository Server_.
The _Remote Repository Server_ itself has to be a _DiscoveryClient_ as well.

[source ,yaml]
----
spring:
  batch:
    lightmin:
      application-name: my-application-name
      lightmin-repository-type: remote
      # default value: false
      discover-remote-repository: true
      # default value: spring-batch-lightmin-repository-server
      remote-repository-server-discovery-name: spring-batch-lightmin-repository-server

----


=== Embedded Server

If you want to use the _SpringBatchLightmin_ in a single application context, an
embedded server mode is provided.

==== Maven Dependencies

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.tuxdevelop</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-batch-lightmin-server</artifactId>
    <version>{spring-batch-lightmin.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

==== Enable the Server

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEmbeddedSpringBatchLightminServer
public class LightminEmbeddedServer {


    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(LightminEmbeddedServer.class, args);
    }
}
----

The code above will boostrap the _SpringBatchLightminClient_ and the
_SpringBatchLightminServer_ in an embedded mode.


=== Remote Repository Server

The third repository type is the _remote repository_. The _Job Configurations_ are located on an external service.

==== Maven

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.tuxdevelop</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-batch-lightmin-repository-server</artifactId>
    <version>{spring-batch-lightmin.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

==== Enable the Remote Repository Server

[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableSpringBatchLightminRemoteRepositoryServer
public class LightminRepositoryServer {


    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(LightminRepositoryServer.class, args);
    }
}
----


=== Getting the lastest SNAPSHOTS

In order to get the latest _SNAPSHOTS_, you have to activate the sonatype snapshot repository.

[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>ossrh</id>
        <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
